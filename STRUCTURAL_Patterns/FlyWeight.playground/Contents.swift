//MARk: - FlyWeight is used for Shares the common object data across calling components.


//What is FlyWeight Design Pattern
//1- FlyWeight pattern avoids creation of large number of similar objects that are required by multiple calling components.
//2- FlyWeight object has 2 types of states which are intrinsic and extrinsic.
//3- Intrinsic state doesnâ€™t change. It is static to the object.
//4- Extrinsic state changes and set by the calling components

//Benefits of FlyWeight Design Pattern
//1- Optimise the performance and reduces of memory foot print of application by sharing the common objects.
//2- Avoids creation of similar objects unnecessarily.
//3- Flexible
